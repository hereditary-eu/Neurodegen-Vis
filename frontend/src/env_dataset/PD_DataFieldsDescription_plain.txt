Data Fields of Patients with PARKINSONS'S Disease

1. record_id: Unique identifier for each patient's record in the database.
2. mh_diagnosis: Mental health diagnosis of the patient. 1 corresponds to Parkinson, 20 to healthy, 
3. npsi_cl_visit_n: Unique identifier for the clinical visit (sequential, referred to the patient, starts from 1, here you can only see selected visits)
4. npsid_visits: Unique identifier for the neuropsycological visit (sequential, referred to the patient, starts from 1, here you can only see selected visits) 
5. npsid_data_npsi: day of neuropsycological assessment.
6. npsid_bdate: Date of birth of the patient.
7. ins_npsi_sex: Sex.
8. insnpsi_age: Age of the patient at the time of the neuropsycological assessment.
9. npsid_rep_moca_c: Raw result of Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test (rep can be ignored, it is related to the fact that the variable is repeated in the data base).
10. npsid_rep_mmse_c: Raw result of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) test.[1]
11. cog_lev_def_2: Level of cognitive assessment. This variable tells us whether a second level of neuropsychological assessment has been carried out, i.e. whether specific assessments have been carried out domain by domain (there will therefore be one score for the attentional domain, one for the executive domain). It is essentially a more specific and extensive assessment than level 1. It refers to specific criteria: we have a level 1 battery and a level 2 battery. In general, level 1 includes the 5 domains (therefore 5 tests which are carried out at patient), level 2 are at least 2 tests per cognitive domain (therefore 10 tests done to the patient).
12. cog_lev_def: Redundant considering 11.
13. npsid_cog_status: Cognitive status of the patient: 1=NoCognitiveImpairment; 2=MildCognitiveImpairment-single-domain; 3-MildCognitiveImpairment-multiple-domain; 4-Dementia. 
It is defined on the basis of all the tests, seeing in which domains the patient does not reach adequate scores (if the z score is less than -1.5 one is considered deficient). 
1st level: MCI if patient falls on at least one domain and/or on a global scale. 
2nd level: MCI if patient falls on at least two domains.
14. npsid_ddur_v: Duration of Parkinson's disease symptoms at the time of the visit[MG2].
15. npsid_age_of_onset: Age of reported symptoms onset (both motor and nonmotor symptoms). 
16. attent_z_comp:  z compound , that is, average on the z scores of the tests carried out by attentional domain.
17. exec_z_comp: average on the z scores of the tests carried out by executive domain.
18. visuosp_z_comp: average on the z scores of the tests done for visuospatial domain.
19. memory_z_comp: average on the z scores of the tests done for memory domain.
20. language_z_comp: average on the z scores of the tests done per language domain.
21. npsid_age_v: Age of the patient at the time of the visit. Redundant respect to 8.
22. attent_sum: number of tests done for the attentional domain.
23. attent_sum_z: sum of the number of tests in which the patient does not reach adequate scores (z score < -1.) in the attentional domain[MG3]. 
24. exec_sum: number of tests done for the executive domain.
25. exec_sum_z: sum of the number of tests in which the patient does not reach adequate scores (z score < -1.) in the executive domain.
26. visuosp_sum: number of tests done for the visuospatial domain.
27. visuosp_sum_z: sum of the number of tests in which the patient does not reach adequate scores (z score < -1.) in the visuospatial domain.
28. memory_sum: number of tests done for the memory domain.
29. memory_sum_z: sum of the number of tests in which the patient does not reach adequate scores (z score < -1.) in the memory domain.
30. language_sum: number of tests done for the language domain.
31. language_sum_z: sum of the number of tests in which the patient does not reach adequate scores (z score < -1.) in the language domain.
32. overall_domain_sum: sum of: 23, 25, 27, 29, 31
33. z_diagnosis: Diagnosis based on tests. It is a kind of diagnosis made with automatic formulas based on test results. For the actual diagnosis of dementia, clinical input is needed. MCI stands for Mild Cognitive Impairment; NC for "No cognitive impairement"; D for Dementia.
34. reg_death_s: Patient death.[MG4]
35. npsi_firstdiag: Diagnosis at first visit, values as for 2) mh_diagnosis.
36. npsi_time_last_v: time since last npsi vist in months.[MG5]
37. npsid_datscan_not_av: blank if there is no DATSCAN available, otherwise it reports  DATSCAN .  DATSCAN  is an exam similar to PET, in which dopamine levels are measured in the basal nuclei, used in the diagnosis of Parkinson's.
38. npsid_datscan_not_av_data: Date of datscan exam.
39. npsid_datscan_not_av_pos: Positive to datscan exam.
40. npsid_datscan_not_[MG6]av_pos_hem: Hemisphere of datscan positivity.
41. npsid_rm: MRI available (yes/no)
42. npsid_rm_date: Date of MRI.
43. npsid_rm_id: Identifier of MRI.
44. free_surfer[MG7]_codes: MRI freesurfer code (for preprocessed data).
45. nspid_rm_protocol: MRI protocol (patients marked with the same protocol were acquired with the same MRI protocol and the same machine).
46. npsid_rm2, npsid_rm_date2, npsid_rm_id2, free_surfer_codes2, nspid_rm_protocol2: as above for a second set of MRI scans.
47. npsid_rm3, npsid_rm_date3, npsid_rm_id3, free_surfer_codes3, nspid_rm_protocol3: as above for a third set of MRI scans.
48. npsid_yearsed: Number of years of education completed by the patient.
49. npsid_educ_range: Range of education level.
50. npsid_age_range: Range of patient's age.
51. npsid_ddur_range: Range of duration since diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.

Nel corso degli anni sono state cambiate varie volte le batterie di test, quindi   neccessario sapere se un paziente ha eseguito o no uno specifico test.
53. soc_cog_sum: number of tests done on the social cognition domain.
54. updrs_3_on: MDS-UPDRS Part III score (motor function while ON medication).
55. ma_subit_hy_on: Rigidity/hypokinesia assessment while ON medication.
56. st_ter_no_calc_leed/st_ter_leed/st_ter_no_calc_daed/st_ter_daed: 
LEED=levodopa equivalent daily dose;
DAED=dopamine agonist daily equivalent dose
for both, the first variable (no_calc) is the value manually inserted (with small error margins), the second is computed with the automated formula.
